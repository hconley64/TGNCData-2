<h1>Who Did We Lose?</h1>
<h3>Mapping the murders of the global Trans and Gender Non-Conforming Community.</h3>
<h4>  By H Conley </h4>

<iframe title="2021  was the deadliest year for TGNC people on record." aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-Aoqmt" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Aoqmt/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="412"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>



<p>This year at least <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://transrespect.org/en/tmm-update-tdor-2021/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1639765739152000&usg=AOvVaw17RqDpcrpytfZpF6aneG19375"> 375 transgender and gender non-conforming individuals </a> were killed worldwide. This number is inherently incomplete as trans people across the world are unable to come out, or are not reported as trans by family or authorities. </p>

<p>Transrespect Versus Transviolence Worldwide (TvT) collected data on those who were identified. "These numbers are just a small glimpse of the reality on the ground,” said the authors of the report. The data only contains, “those which can be found on the Internet, along with those murders that reported to us by local activists or our partner organizations.”</p>

<p>But the data that is available reveals a great deal about who is at heightened risk for violence, where and why.</p>

<p>Loss was centered in North, Central and South America with Brazil being by far the deadliest country for gender diverse individuals. Mexico had just over half that of Brazil, and the USA was not far behind. There are few individuals identified in Africa, the Middle East, China, and other regions, likely due to lack of reporting.</p>

<p>Transwomen and transfeminine individuals made up 96% of the total. Just under ¼ of all of those lost were sex workers. More than ⅓ of those killed were in their 20s and of that group 31% were sex workers.</p>

<p>Transwomen, especially those in their teens and 20s are often forced into survival sex work. “Homelessness is one of the most common drivers of youth engagement in survival sex,” according to a 2015 <a  href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/42186/2000119-Surviving-the-Streets-of-New-York.pdf">study</a> by The Urban Institute and Streetwise and Safe.</p>

<p>Young trans people are at a higher risk for homelessness as they are more likely to be kicked out by parents and guardians who don’t approve of their gender identity or expression.</p>

<p>The 2015 study shows that 50% of unhoused or runaway youth trade sex for shelter or for money to provide shelter for themselves. “Nationally, 48% of transgender people
reporting involvement in sex work also report homelessness,” said the authors of the study.
</p>


<p>Survival sex work is made more dangerous by homelessness. Tahtiana Fermin, the founder of TGNC Bridges4Life, has been a sex worker since 2008 and a phone sex operator since 2011. Before gaining the safety of phone sex, she said that having clients come to her home was key to her safety.</p>

<p>“I had a pit bull that used to stand behind my door,” said Fermin. Her pit bull, combined with an ADT alarm system that required a code to open the door, saved her from multiple dangerous  situations. She ensured that men coming to her home knew that they couldn’t leave without her entering the code.</p>

<p>She had one client who panicked after seeing her safety precautions and admitted, “I gotta be honest with you, I don't have no money. I didn't come here to have sex with you. I came here to rob you,” she said.</p>

<p>This happened on two separate occasions. </p>

<p>Sex workers who lack the ability to control their interactions are at much higher risk of being taking advantage of or attacked. But, being a sex worker can make it harder to obtain and keep housing. Banks can turn sex workers away when applying for accounts and without a bank account or pay stubs, it is nearly impossible to obtain a lease.</p>

<p>Even though Fermin is a phone sex operator, a legal job, she was turned away from three or four banks before she was able to secure an account. “Literally, this is something that I pay taxes for,” she said. She became a roadside assistant in order to be approved for a bank account, although the phone sex was still her primary source of income.</p>

<p>Since sex work is criminalized in many countries, workers lack recourse if they are attacked or robbed. If you’re engaged in a criminal activity, the police might arrest you instead of the person putting you in danger.  Those who hire sex workers are well aware of this. “They also feel like we don't have rights and they feel like they can take over,” Fermin said.</p>

<p>In order to protect sex workers she believes in the Nordic model where prostitution is decriminalized, but buying sex is illegal. It also criminalizes pimping, brothel keeping and sex trafficking, This system offers increased protection to workers with the goal of decreasing demand overall. </p>

<p>“I think that actually decriminalizing sex work will make it easier to pin point the people who are being sex trafficked or the people are being forced to do sex work,” said Fermin.</p>

<p>The compounding stigma against transwomen and sex workers is likely the cause of around ¼ of the deaths this year. Fermin created TGNC Bridges4Life’s “Sex Work is Work” campaign, which is designed to fight this stigma and increase acceptance of transwomen who are just trying to make a living.</p>

<p>“The average trans woman that is out here sex working is probably a person who does not want to sell their body to survive,” said Fermin. “She is a sister, a daughter, sometimes a wife, and they're trying to survive, literally.”</p>
